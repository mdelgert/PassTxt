If the `xxd` command is not available on your system, you can use alternative tools or methods to convert the binary file into a C array. Here are some options:

---

### 1. **Install `xxd`**
The `xxd` tool is part of the `vim-common` package. You can install it as follows:

#### On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install vim-common
```

#### On macOS (with Homebrew):
```bash
brew install vim
```

After installation, try running the `xxd` command again:

```bash
xxd -i web/favicon.ico > favicon_ico.h
```

---

### 2. **Use Python to Generate the C Array**
If installing `xxd` is not an option, you can use Python to convert the file into a C array.

Run this Python script in the same directory as `favicon.ico`:

```python
input_file = "web/favicon.ico"
output_file = "favicon_ico.h"

with open(input_file, "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()

with open(output_file, "w") as f:
    f.write("unsigned char favicon_ico[] = {\n")
    for i, byte in enumerate(data):
        f.write(f"  0x{byte:02x},")
        if (i + 1) % 12 == 0:  # 12 bytes per line
            f.write("\n")
    f.write("\n};\n")
    f.write(f"unsigned int favicon_ico_len = {len(data)};\n")
```

This will generate the `favicon_ico.h` file containing the C array.

### 3. **Online Tools**
There are also online tools that can convert binary files to C arrays. Simply upload your `favicon.ico` file, and they will generate the corresponding C code:
- [Binary to C Array Converter](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bin2c/)

Once you have the `favicon_ico.h` file, follow the steps to include and serve it in your project as described earlier. Let me know if you need further assistance!
