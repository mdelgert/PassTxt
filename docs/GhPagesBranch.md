The `gh-pages` branch is a special branch that GitHub uses to serve content for GitHub Pages. When you configure GitHub Pages in your repository, it allows you to specify where the site’s content is sourced from. Commonly, this can be:

1. **Main or Other Branch with a Subfolder**:
   - Content is served from a specified folder (e.g., `docs/`) in the `main` branch or another branch.

2. **`gh-pages` Branch**:
   - Content is served directly from the root of the `gh-pages` branch.

### Why Use the `gh-pages` Branch?

The `gh-pages` branch is useful for:
- **Isolating Deployment Artifacts**: The `gh-pages` branch only contains the static site files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.), while the `main` branch contains the source code for the project. This separation keeps the repository organized.
- **Simpler Hosting**: By using a separate branch, you can easily manage and deploy static files without cluttering your main development branch.

### What Happens if You Change the Trigger to a Tag?

If your GitHub Action builds and deploys to the `gh-pages` branch, the site will still be published regardless of whether the action is triggered by a push to `main` or a tag, as long as:
1. The GitHub Pages settings in your repository are configured to source the site from the `gh-pages` branch.
2. Your workflow deploys the built files to the `gh-pages` branch.

### Example: GitHub Pages Workflow for `gh-pages` Deployment

Here’s how a typical GitHub Pages deployment workflow might look:

```yaml
name: Deploy GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    tags:
      - "v*.*.*"

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build site
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./build
          destination_branch: gh-pages
```

In this example:
- The workflow builds the static site (e.g., with a static site generator like React, Vue, or Jekyll).
- It deploys the output (`./build` directory) to the `gh-pages` branch.

### How Does the `gh-pages` Branch Work?

1. **Static Site Hosting**: GitHub Pages uses the content in the `gh-pages` branch to serve the website.
2. **Auto-Publishing**: GitHub automatically recognizes changes in the `gh-pages` branch and updates the published site.
3. **Commit History**: The `gh-pages` branch often has its own commit history separate from the `main` branch, containing only the built files.

---

### Why Do People Use `gh-pages`?

1. **Cleaner Source Code**: The source code and the build output are kept in separate branches, making it easier to manage.
2. **Reusable Build Process**: You can rebuild and redeploy the site independently of changes to the main codebase.
3. **Flexibility**: The `gh-pages` branch can be updated by automation (e.g., GitHub Actions), while the `main` branch remains focused on development.

---

### What Happens If You Switch Triggers?

- If you change the trigger to run on tags instead of pushes to `main`, the workflow will only deploy to `gh-pages` when a new tag is created and pushed.
- **The site will still publish**, provided the `gh-pages` branch is updated during the workflow.
