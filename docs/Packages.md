### **Why Check in `package.json`?**
- **Purpose**: Defines your project dependencies and scripts.
- **Reason to Commit**: Other developers or CI systems (like GitHub Actions) will use this file to install the required dependencies for your project.
- **Required by Tools**: `npm install` uses `package.json` to determine which dependencies to install.

---

### **Why Check in `package-lock.json`?**
- **Purpose**: Ensures consistent and reproducible builds by locking exact versions of dependencies and their sub-dependencies.
- **Reason to Commit**:
  - Prevents version mismatches across different environments (e.g., your local machine, CI, or other developers' systems).
  - Guarantees the same dependency tree is installed everywhere.

---

### **Best Practices for `package.json` and `package-lock.json`**
1. **Always Commit Both**:
   - They complement each other: `package.json` defines the dependencies, while `package-lock.json` locks the exact versions.

2. **Avoid Manually Editing `package-lock.json`**:
   - It’s auto-generated by `npm`. Let npm handle it.

3. **Regenerate Lock File Periodically**:
   - Run `npm install` occasionally to update the `package-lock.json` for newer versions within the allowed range (if `package.json` uses version ranges like `^1.0.0`).

---

### **When to Exclude `package-lock.json`**
The only time you might exclude `package-lock.json` is if you’re building a reusable **library** (not an application) because:
- Consumers of the library will resolve their own dependencies.
- Including a `package-lock.json` might cause conflicts with the consuming projects.

For most projects (like your website), **you should include `package-lock.json`.**

---

### **Git Ignore Example**
Ensure your `.gitignore` does **not** exclude `package.json` or `package-lock.json`. It should look like this:

```plaintext
# Ignore Node.js dependencies folder
node_modules/

# Ignore logs
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# Ignore OS-specific files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

---

### **Steps to Add to Git**
1. Stage both files:
   ```bash
   git add package.json package-lock.json
   ```

2. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add package.json and package-lock.json"
   ```

3. Push to the repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

---

### **Recap**
- **Check in both `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.**
- These files ensure your project has consistent and reproducible builds.
- The only Node.js file you should exclude is `node_modules/`.
