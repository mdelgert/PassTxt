The decision to place `#include` statements in the header file (`.h`) versus the implementation file (`.cpp`) depends on the context and intent. Here's an explanation of why it was moved to the `.cpp` file in this case and the general considerations for deciding where to place `#include` directives:

---

### **Why It Was Moved to the `.cpp` File**
1. **Avoiding Unnecessary Coupling**:
   - If `DeviceHandler.h` is included in `JiggleHandler.h`, any file that includes `JiggleHandler.h` will also indirectly include `DeviceHandler.h`. This can unnecessarily increase the coupling between files, which might lead to longer compile times and more dependencies.

2. **Implementation Detail**:
   - `DeviceHandler::sendMouseMovement` is only used in the `.cpp` file, so `DeviceHandler.h` is only needed in the implementation file (`JiggleHandler.cpp`). By including it in the `.cpp` file, we limit its scope to where itâ€™s actually used.

3. **Header File Hygiene**:
   - Including only what's necessary in the header file makes the code cleaner and reduces potential for conflicts (e.g., duplicate definitions or namespace clashes).

### **When to Include in the `.h` File**
You should include a header file in another header file **only** when the included file's definitions are required for the declarations in the `.h` file. Common scenarios:
1. **Inheritance**:
   - If the class inherits from another class, the base class's header must be included.
   ```cpp
   #include "BaseClass.h"
   class DerivedClass : public BaseClass { ... };
   ```

2. **Member Variables or Return Types**:
   - If a member variable is an instance of another class or a method return type is dependent on another class:
   ```cpp
   #include "OtherClass.h"
   class MyClass {
       OtherClass member;
   };
   ```

3. **Templates**:
   - Templates require full type information at compile time, so you need to include their definitions in the `.h` file.
   ```cpp
   #include <vector>
   class MyClass {
       std::vector<int> numbers;
   };
   ```

### **When to Include in the `.cpp` File**
Include the header file in the `.cpp` file when:
1. **Implementation Details**:
   - If the included class is only used in the implementation (e.g., for local variables, helper functions).

2. **Forward Declarations in the Header**:
   - Use a forward declaration in the `.h` file to avoid including the entire header, then include the header in the `.cpp` file.
   ```cpp
   // JiggleHandler.h
   class DeviceHandler; // Forward declaration
   ```

   ```cpp
   // JiggleHandler.cpp
   #include "DeviceHandler.h"
   ```

3. **Reducing Compile Times**:
   - Avoid unnecessarily including large headers in `.h` files that are widely included across the project.

---

### **Guidelines and Best Practices**
1. **Minimize Includes in Header Files**:
   - Headers should declare as much as possible while including as little as possible. Use forward declarations where applicable.

2. **Include Only What's Necessary**:
   - For example, avoid including large headers or entire libraries unless required for the declaration.

3. **Keep Dependencies Local**:
   - By including files in `.cpp` instead of `.h`, you reduce the likelihood of cascading include issues and make the project easier to maintain.

---

### **Why the Mix of Implementations?**
- Some developers include headers in `.h` files out of convenience or lack of awareness of the compile-time impact.
- In smaller projects or those with minimal dependencies, the cost of including files in `.h` might not be noticeable.
- In larger projects, following best practices becomes crucial to keep compile times manageable and avoid coupling.

---

### **Key Takeaway**
If the dependency is only needed for the implementation, include it in the `.cpp` file. If the dependency is required for declarations or as part of the class interface (e.g., public member variables or return types), include it in the `.h` file.

For `DeviceHandler.h`, since it's only used in the implementation of `performJiggle`, moving it to the `.cpp` file aligns with best practices by keeping the header file clean and reducing unnecessary coupling.
