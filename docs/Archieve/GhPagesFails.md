### **Steps to Resolve the Issue**

#### **1. Enable GitHub Pages for Your Repository**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Pages**.
3. Set the source branch to `gh-pages` (if available) or follow the default GitHub Pages configuration.

---

#### **2. Ensure GitHub Actions Has Write Permissions**
1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**.
2. Under **Workflow permissions**, ensure **Read and write permissions** is selected.
3. Save changes.

---

#### **3. Check Your `deploy.yml` File**
Ensure the GitHub Actions workflow uses the correct token and configuration.

**`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` Example:**
```yaml
name: Deploy Website

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install dependencies
        working-directory: website
        run: npm install

      - name: Build website
        working-directory: website
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: website/dist
```

- Ensure `github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` is included.
- The `publish_dir` points to the output directory (`dist`).

---

#### **4. Validate Your Repository URL**
Verify that your repository name and URL are correct in the workflow logs:
- It should match the repository you're working on.
- If you've renamed or moved the repository, update any references in the workflow file.

---

#### **5. Rerun the Workflow**
1. Push your changes to trigger the workflow:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository.
3. Select the latest workflow run and check if it succeeds.

---

#### **6. If You Still See a 403 Error**
If the above steps don’t resolve the issue:
- **Verify Repository Ownership**:
  - Ensure you have admin rights to the repository.
- **Recreate the Personal Access Token (if needed)**:
  - Navigate to **Settings** → **Developer settings** → **Personal access tokens**.
  - Generate a new token with full repository access.
  - Update your workflow to use the token.
