Act as an expert embedded systems programmer with deep knowledge of modern C programming best practices for microcontrollers. Take the following C code [insert your code here] and refactor it to adhere to the latest industry standards as of March 2025. Apply the following guidelines:

1. **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names. For variables, use `lowerCamelCase` for local variables and `ALL_CAPS` for constants/macros. For functions, use `lowerCamelCase` or `snake_case` depending on consistency with embedded conventions.
2. **Spacing and Formatting**: Follow consistent indentation (e.g., 2 or 4 spaces), add spaces around operators (e.g., `x = y + z`), and group related code with blank lines for readability.
3. **Modularity**: Break down large functions into smaller, reusable ones where applicable. Ensure each function has a single responsibility.
4. **Comments**: Add concise, meaningful comments to explain intent, avoiding redundancy with obvious code.
5. **Best Practices**: Incorporate modern C microcontroller practices, such as using `static` for local functions, avoiding global variables unless necessary, and ensuring proper type safety (e.g., `uint8_t` over `int` where appropriate).
6. **Error Handling**: Suggest basic error-checking mechanisms if missing (e.g., null checks, return value validation).
7. **Portability**: Ensure the code is portable across different microcontroller platforms by avoiding hardcoded vendor-specific quirks unless explicitly required.
8. Optimize the code with best praticies.

Below is the code to optimize.
