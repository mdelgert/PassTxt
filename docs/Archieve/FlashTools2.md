If your firmware files are not combined (i.e., they include separate bootloader, partition table, and application files), you need to upload them to their specific addresses in the ESP32-S3 flash memory using the **ESP Flash Download Tool**. Here’s the step-by-step process:

### **Steps for Flashing Separate Files**

1. **Gather the Necessary Files**
   - Ensure you have the following files:
     - **Bootloader binary**: Typically named `bootloader.bin`.
     - **Partition table binary**: Typically named `partition-table.bin`.
     - **Application binary**: The main firmware file, often named `firmware.bin`.

2. **Launch the ESP Flash Download Tool**
   - Download and open the **ESP Flash Download Tool**.

3. **Select the ESP32-S3 Chip**
   - Choose **ESP32-S3** from the chip list.

4. **Configure the Files and Addresses**
   - In the **Download Path Config** section:
     - **Bootloader**: Select the `bootloader.bin` file and set the address to `0x0`.
     - **Partition Table**: Select the `partition-table.bin` file and set the address to `0x8000`.
     - **Application Firmware**: Select the `firmware.bin` file and set the address to `0x10000`.

   Your configuration should look something like this:
   | File                 | Address   |
   |----------------------|-----------|
   | `bootloader.bin`     | `0x0`     |
   | `partition-table.bin`| `0x8000`  |
   | `firmware.bin`       | `0x10000` |

   **Note**: These addresses are standard for ESP32 firmware but verify with your firmware documentation in case they differ.

5. **Set Flash Configuration**
   - Confirm the following settings:
     - **Crystal Frequency**: `40MHz` (matches your ESP32-S3).
     - **SPI Flash Size**: Select `16MB` (as detected by the tool).
     - **SPI Mode**: Typically `DIO` or `QIO`, depending on your firmware (default is usually fine).
     - **Baud Rate**: Set a suitable baud rate (e.g., `921600` or `115200`).

6. **Put the ESP32-S3 into Bootloader Mode**
   - Press and hold the **BOOT** button on the ESP32-S3 (if available) while pressing and releasing the **RESET** button.
   - Release the **BOOT** button after resetting.

7. **Select the COM Port**
   - Choose the COM port where your ESP32-S3 is connected.

8. **Start the Flashing Process**
   - Click **Start** to upload the files.
   - The tool will upload each file to its specified address and verify them.

### **Erasing Flash**
- Before flashing the separate files, it’s recommended to erase the flash memory to avoid conflicts:
  - Click the **Erase** button in the tool before starting the upload process.

### **Verify Your Firmware**
After the upload is complete, you can verify the firmware by:
1. **Connecting to the Serial Monitor**:
   - Use a tool like the Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, or a serial terminal (e.g., PuTTY, CoolTerm).
2. **Monitor the Boot Process**:
   - Check if the ESP32-S3 boots correctly and outputs logs.

### **Standard Flash Memory Layout**
Here’s a typical memory layout for the ESP32-S3:

| Memory Region          | Start Address | Notes                            |
|------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Bootloader             | `0x0`         | Required to initialize the chip. |
| Partition Table        | `0x8000`      | Contains flash partition info.   |
| Application Firmware   | `0x10000`     | Main program.                    |

If your firmware uses additional partitions (e.g., OTA), refer to your partition table configuration for their addresses.
