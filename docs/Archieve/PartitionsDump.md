The `esptool.py` command you tried does not include a direct `partition_table` operation. However, you can extract and inspect the partition table using the following steps:

---

### Step 1: Read the Partition Table from Flash
The ESP32 partition table is typically located at **offset 0x8000** in the flash memory. You can read this section using `esptool.py`:

```bash
esptool.py --port /dev/ttyACM0 read_flash 0x8000 0x1000 partition_table.bin
```

- Replace `/dev/ttyACM0` with your actual serial port.
- This command reads the partition table (4KB = 0x1000) starting at the default offset (0x8000) into a file called `partition_table.bin`.

---

### Step 2: Inspect the Partition Table
To inspect the contents of the partition table, you can use the `parttool.py` utility, which is included with the ESP-IDF.

#### Option A: Using `parttool.py` (Requires ESP-IDF)
1. Run the following command to inspect the extracted partition table:
   ```bash
   python $IDF_PATH/components/partition_table/parttool.py --partition-table-file partition_table.bin list
   ```
   - This lists the partitions and their details, including offsets, sizes, and types.

---

### Step 3: Validate the Table
Compare the extracted partition table with your custom `partitions.csv` to identify any discrepancies. Ensure:
1. The offsets and sizes do not overlap.
2. The total size fits within your flash memory (16MB = 0x1000000).

---

### If You Donâ€™t Have `parttool.py`
If you're not using ESP-IDF, you can manually inspect the binary with a hex editor or parse it using a script.

#### Example Hexdump Command:
```bash
hexdump -C partition_table.bin
```

The partition table format is described in the [ESP-IDF Partition Table documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/partition-tables.html).

---

### Next Steps
Once you have the extracted partition table, compare its details against your custom `partitions.csv` and let me know the results. We can further refine your partition configuration based on this information.

Your hexdump reveals the contents of a valid partition table from the ESP32 flash memory. Let's break it down and analyze it against your expectations.

---

### Decoding the Partition Table
Each partition entry in the table is 32 bytes, starting with the magic byte sequence `aa 50`.

#### **Extracted Partition Table**
| Offset (hex) | Name      | Type  | SubType | Start Addr (hex) | Size (hex) | Description      |
|--------------|-----------|-------|---------|------------------|------------|------------------|
| `0x0000`     | `nvs`     | `data`| `nvs`   | `0x9000`         | `0x5000`   | Non-volatile storage |
| `0x0020`     | `otadata` | `data`| `ota`   | `0xe000`         | `0x2000`   | OTA data partition |
| `0x0040`     | `app0`    | `app` | `ota_0` | `0x10000`        | `0x330000` | OTA app slot 0   |
| `0x0060`     | `app1`    | `app` | `ota_1` | `0x340000`       | `0x330000` | OTA app slot 1   |
| `0x0080`     | `spiffs`  | `data`| `spiffs`| `0x670000`       | `0x180000` | SPIFFS storage   |
| `0x00a0`     | `coredump`| `data`| `coredump` | `0x7f0000`     | `0x10000`  | Core dump area   |

### Comparison Against Your Custom Table
#### Observations:
1. **Partition Alignment**:
   - This table ensures all partitions are aligned and there is no overlap.
   - Partition offsets and sizes are properly configured.

2. **Larger App Slots**:
   - Each OTA slot (`app0` and `app1`) is **0x330000** (3.2MB). In your custom table, they were 4MB each.

3. **Smaller SPIFFS (or LittleFS) Partition**:
   - The extracted table allocates `0x180000` (1.5MB) for `spiffs`, while your custom table allocates 7.8MB for storage.

4. **Missing `phy_init` Partition**:
   - The extracted table does not include a `phy_init` partition, suggesting it is not needed for your board configuration or the firmware.

---

### Updated Custom Partition Table
To create a compatible partition table, align it closer to the working one extracted from the flash. Adjust for LittleFS and OTA requirements:

```csv
# Compatible Partition Table for 16MB Flash with LittleFS
# Name,      Type,   SubType,  Offset,    Size,       Flags
nvs,         data,   nvs,      0x009000,  0x005000    # NVS (20KB)
otadata,     data,   ota,      0x00E000,  0x002000    # OTA data (8KB)
app0,        app,    ota_0,    0x010000,  0x330000    # OTA slot 0 (3.2MB)
app1,        app,    ota_1,    0x340000,  0x330000    # OTA slot 1 (3.2MB)
storage,     data,   spiffs,   0x670000,  0x180000    # LittleFS storage (1.5MB)
coredump,    data,   coredump, 0x7f0000,  0x010000    # Core dump (64KB)
```

---

### Key Adjustments:
1. **OTA Slot Sizes**:
   - Reduced to 3.2MB (`0x330000`), matching the extracted table.

2. **LittleFS Storage**:
   - Reduced to 1.5MB (`0x180000`), aligning with the extracted `spiffs` partition.

3. **No `phy_init` Partition**:
   - Excluded, as it was not present in the extracted table and does not appear necessary.

---

### Steps to Test
1. Save the updated `partitions.csv` file.
2. Update `platformio.ini` to point to the new partition table:
   ```ini
   board_build.partitions = tools/partitions.csv
   board_build.flash_size = 16MB
   board_build.filesystem = littlefs
   ```
3. Erase the flash memory:
   ```bash
   esptool.py erase_flash
   ```
4. Rebuild and upload both the firmware and filesystem:
   ```bash
   pio run --target buildfs
   pio run --target uploadfs
   pio run --target upload
   ```
5. Monitor the serial output:
   ```bash
   pio device monitor --baud 115200
   ```

---

### Expected Result
The board should now:
1. Boot successfully.
2. Use LittleFS for file storage.
3. Support OTA updates with the adjusted partition sizes.

Let me know if this resolves the issue or if further tweaks are needed!
