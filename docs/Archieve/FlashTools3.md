Looking at your partition table hexdump, here is what can be interpreted:

### **Partition Details**
- Each entry starts with `aa 50` (magic header for a valid partition entry).
- The entries in your partition table correspond to different partitions.

From your dump:
1. **NVS (Non-Volatile Storage)**:
   - Offset: `0x9000`
   - Size: `0x5000`
   - Name: `nvs`

2. **OTA Data**:
   - Offset: `0xE000`
   - Size: `0x2000`
   - Name: `otadata`

3. **Application Slot 0 (app0)**:
   - Offset: `0x10000`
   - Size: `0x330000`
   - Name: `app0`

4. **Application Slot 1 (app1)**:
   - Offset: `0x340000`
   - Size: `0x330000`
   - Name: `app1`

5. **SPIFFS (Filesystem)**:
   - Offset: `0x670000`
   - Size: `0x180000`
   - Name: `spiffs`

6. **Core Dump**:
   - Offset: `0x7F0000`
   - Size: `0x10000`
   - Name: `coredump`

### **Determining LittleFS**
- In your partition table, the only partition labeled as a filesystem is `spiffs` (at offset `0x670000`, size `0x180000`).
- By default, Espressif uses **SPIFFS** as the filesystem, but if your project uses **LittleFS**, it could have replaced the SPIFFS partition. In this case:
  - The `littlefs.bin` should be flashed to the **SPIFFS** partition offset: `0x670000`.

---

### **How to Flash `littlefs.bin`**
1. **Determine the Partition Type**:
   - Confirm whether your project is configured to use **LittleFS** instead of **SPIFFS** (check your `sdkconfig` or project documentation).
2. **Set the Flash Address**:
   - Use the address for the SPIFFS partition: **`0x670000`**.
3. **Use ESP Flash Download Tool**:
   - Add `littlefs.bin` under the "Download Path Config".
   - Set the address to **`0x670000`**.
4. **Flash the Partition**:
   - Follow the usual steps to flash using the ESP Flash Download Tool.

---

### **Verifying LittleFS**
After flashing:
1. **Check Logs**:
   - Use a serial monitor to verify that the ESP32-S3 mounts the filesystem correctly at runtime.
   - Look for messages indicating the successful mounting of **LittleFS**.

2. **Test Access**:
   - If possible, test read/write operations to the filesystem to confirm it's working.
