For local development where security is not a concern, you can set up permissive CORS headers that allow everything. Here's how you can modify your function to ensure maximum openness:

### Fully Open CORS Headers for Development
```cpp
void WebHandler::addCorsHeaders(AsyncWebServerResponse *response)
{
    if (settings.cors) return;

    // Allow any origin
    response->addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");

    // Allow all standard HTTP methods
    response->addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS");

    // Allow any headers the client may send
    response->addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "*");

    // Allow credentials (optional, in case cookies or Authorization are needed)
    response->addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", "true");

    // Set max age for preflight requests (optional, but improves efficiency)
    response->addHeader("Access-Control-Max-Age", "86400");
}
```

### Explanation of Each Header
1. **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`**:
   - This allows requests from any origin.

2. **`Access-Control-Allow-Methods`**:
   - Includes all typical HTTP methods you might use during development.

3. **`Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *`**:
   - Opens up the headers to accept any custom or standard headers from the client. This is critical for APIs expecting custom headers during testing.

4. **`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`**:
   - Allows credentials like cookies or Authorization headers. This is optional, but useful if your frontend sends authenticated requests during development.

5. **`Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400`**:
   - Caches the preflight response for 24 hours to reduce the number of preflight requests during testing.

### Notes
- This setup ensures that your development environment has no restrictions.
- When `settings.cors` is enabled, this permissive behavior will be bypassed, enabling secure configurations for production.
