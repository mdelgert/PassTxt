### Default PlatformIO Partitions on ESP32

The ESP32 uses a partition table to divide its flash memory into multiple sections, each serving a specific purpose. The default partition table typically includes the following partitions:

1. **bootloader**: Contains the bootloader, responsible for initializing hardware and starting the main firmware.
2. **nvs (Non-Volatile Storage)**: Stores system settings, user preferences, or any other data that must persist across reboots.
3. **otadata**: Stores OTA (Over-the-Air) update information, such as the active firmware slot.
4. **app (factory, ota_0, ota_1)**: Stores the actual application code (your firmware).
5. **spiffs/littlefs**: Reserved for file systems like SPIFFS or LittleFS for storing user files.
6. **reserved/other**: Can include custom partitions defined in your `partition.csv`.

Example default `partitions.csv` for ESP32:

```csv
# Name,   Type, SubType, Offset,  Size, Flags
nvs,      data, nvs,     0x9000,  0x5000,
otadata,  data, ota,     0xe000,  0x2000,
app0,     app,  ota_0,   0x10000, 0x140000,
app1,     app,  ota_1,   0x150000,0x140000,
spiffs,   data, spiffs,  0x290000,0x170000,
```

### Reading the Partition Table

You can use PlatformIO's tools or ESP-IDF utilities to inspect the partition table:

1. **Run a Partition Table Dump**:
   Use this command to view the partition details:
   ```bash
   platformio run --target partition_table
   ```

2. **In Code**:
   Use the ESP-IDF `esp_partition_*` APIs to access partition details in your firmware:
   ```cpp
   #include "esp_partition.h"

   void print_partition_info() {
       const esp_partition_t *partition = esp_ota_get_running_partition();
       printf("Running partition: %s, type: %d, subtype: %d\n",
              partition->label, partition->type, partition->subtype);
   }
   ```

### Multiple App Partitions & OTA

#### What are Multiple App Partitions?

ESP32 supports multiple application partitions (e.g., `app0`, `app1`) to enable **Over-the-Air (OTA)** updates. Each application partition stores a different version of your firmware, allowing the device to switch between them.

- `app0` and `app1`: Two slots to store firmware images.
- Only one slot is active (running) at a time.
- The OTA update process writes the new firmware to the inactive slot.

#### Why Does OTA Require a Partition?

OTA updates require a separate partition to:
1. Store the incoming firmware while the current firmware is running.
2. Allow a fallback mechanism if the new firmware fails to boot.

The `otadata` partition keeps track of the active and inactive firmware slots and is updated during OTA.

#### How Does OTA Work?

1. **Initial Boot**:
   - The ESP32 boots from the active application partition (`app0` or `app1`).
   - The `otadata` partition tracks which partition is active.

2. **OTA Update Process**:
   - The firmware is downloaded (via HTTP, MQTT, etc.) and written to the inactive application partition.
   - Example libraries:
     - ESP-IDF: `esp_ota_begin`, `esp_ota_write`, `esp_ota_end`
     - Arduino: `Update` class
   - After successful download, `esp_ota_set_boot_partition` or its Arduino equivalent updates the boot partition.

3. **Reboot & Validation**:
   - The device reboots and runs the new firmware from the updated partition.
   - If the new firmware fails (e.g., crashes), the device can revert to the old firmware.

#### Example OTA Code (Arduino)

```cpp
#include <HTTPUpdate.h>

void performOTAUpdate() {
    String url = "http://example.com/firmware.bin";
    t_httpUpdate_return result = httpUpdate.update(url);

    if (result == HTTP_UPDATE_OK) {
        Serial.println("OTA Update successful!");
    } else {
        Serial.printf("OTA Update failed: %d\n", result);
    }
}
```

### Summary

- The partition table divides flash memory into sections for bootloader, apps, filesystem, etc.
- OTA requires multiple app partitions to allow safe updates with fallback mechanisms.
- `otadata` manages the active firmware slot and switching logic.
- OTA works by writing new firmware to an inactive slot and rebooting into it after successful validation.

### Multiple App Partitions Explained

#### What Are Multiple App Partitions?
ESP32’s flash memory can be divided into multiple **app (application)** partitions. Common configurations include:
- **Single app partition (factory)**: Only one partition contains the firmware.
- **Multiple app partitions (e.g., factory, ota_0, ota_1)**: Multiple slots are available to store different versions of the firmware, typically for **OTA updates**.

For example:
- `app0` (or `ota_0`): The current firmware.
- `app1` (or `ota_1`): A slot to store the updated firmware during an OTA update.

The ESP32 bootloader decides which app partition to load at startup, based on data stored in the `otadata` partition.

#### Benefits of Multiple App Partitions

1. **Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates**:
   - **Safe Firmware Updates**: The new firmware is written to the inactive partition while the current firmware continues running. If something goes wrong (e.g., power loss or corrupted update), the device still boots into the current firmware.
   - **Rollback Support**: If the updated firmware fails to boot, the bootloader can roll back to the previous version automatically.

2. **Backup & Redundancy**:
   - Having multiple app partitions ensures you always have a working firmware version available. This is particularly useful in remote or inaccessible devices where physical updates are impractical.

3. **Flexible Development**:
   - Developers can store a test version or alternate firmware in the second partition, making it easy to switch between firmware versions without reflashing.

4. **Ease of Troubleshooting**:
   - If an update breaks the firmware, you can manually switch back to the previous partition.

#### Downsides of Multiple App Partitions

1. **Reduced Flash Space for Other Features**:
   - Each app partition reserves a portion of the ESP32’s limited flash memory. For example, in a 4MB flash:
     - Single app partition: ~2.7MB for firmware, more space for file system (SPIFFS/LittleFS).
     - Dual app partitions: Each app gets ~1.4MB, reducing space for the file system.

2. **Complexity**:
   - Managing OTA updates, partition selection, and validation logic adds complexity to your firmware. While libraries and frameworks (e.g., Arduino or ESP-IDF) abstract most of this, there’s still an added layer of functionality to manage.

3. **Increased Boot Time**:
   - The bootloader must verify and decide which app partition to load, slightly increasing boot time compared to single app configurations.

---

#### Why Would You Want Multiple App Partitions?

1. **Remote or IoT Devices**:
   - If the ESP32 is deployed in a location where physical access is difficult (e.g., sensors on rooftops, industrial equipment, or remote farms), OTA updates are critical to ensure firmware can be updated without manual intervention.

2. **Frequent Firmware Updates**:
   - Devices that require frequent updates (e.g., development boards, prototypes, or dynamically evolving IoT products) benefit greatly from the flexibility of multiple app partitions.

3. **Fail-Safe Requirements**:
   - Mission-critical devices where failures are unacceptable (e.g., medical devices, safety systems, or industrial control systems) can use multiple app partitions as a fail-safe mechanism to ensure at least one version of the firmware always works.

---

#### Why Would You Exclude Multiple App Partitions?

1. **Limited Flash Space**:
   - If your application relies heavily on file system storage (e.g., for storing logs, media, or data), reducing app partitions to a single app provides more space for these features.

2. **Simple Applications**:
   - If your firmware rarely (or never) needs updates after deployment, a single app partition simplifies the design and frees up resources.

3. **Development/Prototyping**:
   - For rapid prototyping or development, OTA is often unnecessary, and using a single app partition reduces complexity.

4. **Cost-Sensitive Designs**:
   - Devices using ESP32 variants with smaller flash sizes (e.g., 2MB) might prioritize maximizing storage for the application or file system rather than reserving space for multiple app partitions.

#### Configuring Single vs. Multiple App Partitions

You define the number of app partitions in the `partitions.csv` file in your PlatformIO or ESP-IDF project.

**Single App Partition Example**:
```csv
# Name,   Type, SubType, Offset,  Size, Flags
nvs,      data, nvs,     0x9000,  0x5000,
app,      app,  factory, 0x10000, 0x290000,
spiffs,   data, spiffs,  0x2F0000,0x110000,
```

**Dual App Partition Example (OTA)**:
```csv
# Name,   Type, SubType, Offset,  Size, Flags
nvs,      data, nvs,     0x9000,  0x5000,
otadata,  data, ota,     0xe000,  0x2000,
app0,     app,  ota_0,   0x10000, 0x140000,
app1,     app,  ota_1,   0x150000,0x140000,
spiffs,   data, spiffs,  0x290000,0x170000,
```

#### Summary: Single vs. Multiple App Partitions

| Feature                   | Single Partition               | Multiple Partitions         |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Flash Space**           | Maximizes available space      | Divided between partitions  |
| **OTA Support**           | No                            | Yes                         |
| **Safety/Fallback**       | No                            | Yes                         |
| **Complexity**            | Simple                        | Requires OTA logic          |

In summary, choose multiple app partitions if you need OTA updates or fail-safe mechanisms, and go with a single app partition if you prioritize simplicity or need to maximize storage for files and application data.
