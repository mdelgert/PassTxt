If the toolchain is causing issues embedding the file, you can manually embed the binary data into your code by converting it into a C array. Here's how you can embed and serve the binary data for `favicon.ico` manually:

---

### 1. **Convert the Binary File to a C Array**

Use the `xxd` tool to convert `favicon.ico` into a C array:

```bash
xxd -i web/favicon.ico > favicon_ico.h
```

This generates a file `favicon_ico.h` containing something like this:

```c
unsigned char favicon_ico[] = {
  0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x10, 0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x04, 0x00,
  0x28, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x16, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  // ...
};
unsigned int favicon_ico_len = 1234;
```

Place the `favicon_ico.h` file in your project’s `include` or `src` directory.

---

### 2. **Include the Binary Array in Your Code**

In your code, include the generated header file:

```cpp
#include "favicon_ico.h"
```

---

### 3. **Serve the Embedded Binary File**

Use the `favicon_ico` array and its length (`favicon_ico_len`) to serve the file:

```cpp
void ServeEmbedded::handleGetRequest(AsyncWebServer &server) {
    // Serve the favicon
    server.on("/favicon.ico", HTTP_GET, [](AsyncWebServerRequest *request) {
        AsyncWebServerResponse *response = request->beginResponse_P(200, "image/x-icon", favicon_ico, favicon_ico_len);
        response->addHeader("Content-Encoding", "identity");
        request->send(response);
    });

    // Other endpoints...
}
```

---

### 4. **Rebuild Your Project**

Clean and rebuild your project:

```bash
pio run -t clean
pio run
```

---

### Advantages of This Approach

1. **Independent of Toolchain**: Avoids embedding issues with the toolchain or `board_build.embed_files`.
2. **Portable**: You can easily transfer the binary data to another environment or project.

---

### Caveats

1. **File Size**: For large files, the generated C array can significantly increase the size of your source code, making it harder to manage.
2. **Manual Updates**: If the binary file changes, you’ll need to regenerate the array using `xxd`.

This method circumvents toolchain bugs and allows you to reliably serve the `favicon.ico` file. Let me know if you need help implementing or debugging this approach!
