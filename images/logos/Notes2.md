## 🎨 **Design Brief: PassTxt Logo**

### 🔖 **Brand Name**
**PassTxt**  
*A hardware-based password manager and automation hub*

---

### 🧠 **Core Identity**

**PassTxt** is a compact, plug-and-play device that automates secure password entry and scripted macros on virtually any system — from locked-down PCs to smart TVs. It combines **security**, **automation**, and **hardware control** in a sleek, portable form factor.

The logo must reflect these three pillars:
- **Security** (password management, encryption)
- **Automation** (scripting, macros, efficiency)
- **Hardware** (USB device, plug-and-play functionality)

---

### 🧩 **Logo Style**
- **Flat design**
- **Moderate complexity** (visual interest without clutter; level 5/10)
- **Geometric and modern**
- **Scalable** for web, icon, and product use

### 🎯 **Visual Elements (Must-Haves)**

| Element                 | Meaning                          | Visual Cue                    |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Padlock**             | Password security                | Central shape                 |
| **Circuit lines**       | Tech / digital infrastructure    | Integrated in padlock design  |
| **USB plug**            | Hardware / plug-and-play         | Base of the padlock           |
| **Gear icon**           | Automation, macro execution      | Inside or overlaid on lock    |
| **Curly brackets `{}`** | Scripting/programming            | Inside or near the gear       |
| **Lightning bolt**      | Macro speed, execution power     | Small accent element          |

*The padlock is the anchor of the design, integrating all these concepts subtly but clearly.*

### 🎨 **Color Palette**

| Color     | Purpose               |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Blue**  | Trust, security, tech  |
| **Orange**| Innovation, energy     |

Use a **balanced combination**: blue for the structure (e.g., lock body), orange for accent (e.g., gear, bolt, script brackets).

---

### ✍️ **Typography (Optional)**

If the logotype is included:
- Use a **modern sans-serif** or **monospaced** font like:
  - *Fira Code*, *JetBrains Mono*, *Montserrat*, or *Inter*
- Stylize **“Pass”** in blue and **“Txt”** in orange to mirror the dual themes
- Text should be **beside** or **below** the symbol for versatility
